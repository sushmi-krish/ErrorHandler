# ErrorHandler
Proper error handling makes code more maintainable and facilitates debugging. It helps developers identify and fix issues during development and maintenance phases. Express comes with a built-in error handler that takes care of any errors that might be encountered in the app. This default error-handling middleware function is added at the end of the middleware function stack.
    1.Throw errors to handle unexpected behaviour.

    2.Handle errors that are thrown.
